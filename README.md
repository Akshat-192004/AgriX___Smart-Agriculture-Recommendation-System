# 🌾 AgriX – Smart AI-Powered Agriculture Recommendation System
AgriX is an intelligent agriculture recommendation system that leverages Machine Learning, IoT, and real-time data to assist farmers in making smarter, data-driven decisions. From selecting the right crop to managing fertilizers and irrigation schedules, AgriX provides personalized insights that boost productivity, sustainability, and profitability.

# Features
**● Crop Recommendation** -
Recommends the most suitable crops based on soil nutrients, pH, temperature, rainfall, and humidity.

**● Fertilizer Recommendation** -
Suggests optimal fertilizers and quantities according to crop and soil health.

**● Irrigation Scheduling** -
Provides insights on when and how much to irrigate to avoid under or overwatering.

**● Pest & Disease Management** -
Warns about possible pest or disease risks by analyzing weather and soil conditions.

**● Interactive Dashboard** -
A clean, simple interface for monitoring farm metrics, receiving recommendations, and viewing real-time updates.

# Working
**● Data Collection** -
Inputs are gathered either through IoT sensors or manual entry.

**● Preprocessing** -
The data is cleaned and formatted for model compatibility.

**● Machine Learning Models** -
Trained models predict the best crops, fertilizers, and strategies based on the input.

**● Recommendations Output**-
Results are displayed on a dashboard and/or sent as alerts to the user.

# Data Fields
The agriculture recommendation system utilizes the following data fields for analysis and generating recommendations:

> N (Nitrogen): 
The ratio of Nitrogen content in the soil, expressed as a percentage.
 
> P (Phosphorous): 
The ratio of Phosphorous content in the soil, expressed as a percentage.

> K (Potassium): 
The ratio of Potassium content in the soil, expressed as a percentage.

> Temperature: 
The temperature at the farm location, measured in degrees Celsius.

> Humidity: 
The relative humidity at the farm location, expressed as a percentage.

> pH: 
The pH value of the soil, indicating its acidity or alkalinity.

> Rainfall: 
The amount of rainfall received at the farm location, measured in millimeters.
